## Current to do:

### Important
- ADC input capped at 1v
	- Need voltage divider so pot doesn't damage the chip
- Logic is 3.3v
	- Connect rotary enc to 3.3v and pot too

### Progression
- Fix WDT reset error
	- enable OOM (out of memory) debugging in PIO
- Figure out how to update ESP core (if that's a thing you can do)
	
- Potentiometer reading
- ESP8266 WiFi testing
- Pseudocode for whole remote
