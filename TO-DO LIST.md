## Current to do:
### Important
- ADC input capped at 1v
	- Need voltage divider so pot doesn't damage the chip
- Logic is 3.3v
	- Connect rotary enc to 3.3v and pot too

*********************************************************************
### Progression
- 3x 100nF caps for the rotary encoder

### Down the track sometime
- Potentiometer reading
- ESP8266 WiFi testing
- Pseudocode for whole remote
- ESP8266 definitions file
